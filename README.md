## Demo

You can check the demo [here](https://mapty-09.netlify.app/).

## How it works

- The browser asks for geolocation once then page is loaded, then a map is shown with current user's location.
- The user can click on any point of the map to enter workout details.
- Once a workout is submitted, it appears on the left sidebar.
- Clicking any of the recorded workouts will zoom the map to its location.
